# Fundamentals Of Data Engineering

These are my notes from the book [Fundamentals Of Data Engineering](https://www.amazon.com/Fundamentals-Data-Engineering-Robust-Systems/dp/1098108302).

Although you can access the content through the [github page](https://github.com/kantarcise/learningFundamentalsOfDataEngineering), this is a served with [mkdocs-material](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/) ðŸ’•

# Why ? ðŸ¤”

This is an amazing book for everyone involved in data.

By the end of the book you'll be better equipped to:

- Understand how data engineering fits into roles like data scientist, analyst, or engineer
- Cut through hype to choose the right tools, architectures, and processes
- Design robust systems using the data engineering lifecycle
- Apply data engineering principles in your day-to-day work
- Solve data problems using a lifecycle-based framework

Which is a pretty good deal. ðŸŽ‰

I thought, I can share some of my highlights from it. If you want to discover more about any of the topics, please check out [the book](https://www.amazon.com/Fundamentals-Data-Engineering-Robust-Systems/dp/1098108302).

> If youâ€™re interested in the book, you can purchase one. It was previously available [via Redpanda](https://go.redpanda.com/fundamentals-of-data-engineering), but the free copy is no longer offered. Now, that link redirects to a guide, which is still useful. 

# The Structure ðŸ”¨

The book consists of 3 parts, made up of 11 chapters and 2 appendices.

Here is the [tree](https://linux.die.net/man/1/tree) of the book.

And the following are my notes, following this structure.

So grateful that this book exists. Thanks to [Joe Reis](https://joereis.substack.com/) and [Matt Housley](https://www.linkedin.com/in/housleymatthew/).
